COE 332: Software Engineering & Design
======================================

The objective of this course is to introduce students to advanced computing
concepts in software engineering, software systems design, cloud computing,
distributed systems, and computational engineering. Through a series of
assignments spanning the course of the semester, students will build a
cloud-based, computational system to interact with a time series dataset and
provide a web-accessible interface to their system.
