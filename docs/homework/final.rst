The Songs of Distant Final
--------------------------

PART 1: Pitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Form groups of two or three students to work collaboratively on the final project.
You may choose your own groups, or you may ask the instructors to assign you to a
group. Please let us know what groups you are in, or if you would like to be assigned
to a group ASAP.

The first part of the final project is to identify an interesting data set that you
want to work on. The data set should be Engineering focused, broadly defined. The
data set should also be amenable to CRUD operations and some sort of analysis (e.g.
plotting some values or generating summary statistics). Most data sets that are in a
*list-of-dictionaries* format and contain time stamps and/or quantitative values
should work. The Meteorite Landing data or ISS Positional data are good 
examples of this, but should not be used for the final project. There are several
links at the bottom of this page to Engineering-focused data sets, but you may
look elsewhere too.

Once your group has identified a potential data set to work on, write up a ~1 page
summary of the proposed title of your project, list of group members, and a description
of the data. Then schedule a ~5 minute meeting with one of the instructors in order
to “pitch” your project. We want to know what the source is of the data, see what
the data looks like, and hear what is your plan for working on the data.

Send an email to wallen@tacc.utexas.edu with the PDF write-up
attached plus a link to your new GitHub repository plus a link to download the
zoom recording. Please include "Final Project" in the subject line. We will clone
all of your repos at the due date / time for evaluation. Only one email
per group is required.
